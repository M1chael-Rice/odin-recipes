        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a sweet baked treat that is recognized by <br>its butter flavor and the inclusion of chocolate chips. Some variations can <br>include nuts, oatmeal or raisins as well.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>120g butter <br><em>(softened)</em></li>
            <li>75g light brown sugar</li>
            <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>180g plain flour</li>
            <li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>150g dark chocolate <br><em>(cut into chunks)</em></li>
         </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with <br>parchment.</li>
                <li>Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, <br>then beat in the egg and vanilla.</li>
                <li>Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
                <li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough <br>space between each to allow for spreading.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the <br>middle &ndash; they will harden a little as they cool.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer <br>to a wire rack to cool completely. <em>Will keep for three days in an <br>airtight container.</em></p>
