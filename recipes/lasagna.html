        <h2>Lasagna</h2>
        <p>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a<br>tomato or white sauce. Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of<br>what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>2tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
            <li>90g pack of proscuitto</li>
            <li>800g passata</li>
            <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
            <li>nutmeg</li>
            <li>300g fresh lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>white sauce</li>
            <li>125g ball of mozzerella<br><em>(torn into thin strips)</em></li>
         </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g <br>lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
                <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the <br>meat mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot <br>beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
                <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish <br>(about 30 x 20cm).</li>
                <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh <br>lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or <br>homemade white sauce.</li>
                <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g <br>white sauce, making sure you can&rsquo;t see any pasta poking through.</li>
                <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
                <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is <br>bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Pull out of the oven and serve immediately with a small salad and a crisp white wine.</p>
